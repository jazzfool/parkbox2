# Parkbox2

Real-time plant growth simulation paired with a Vulkan rendering engine specialized for dense foliage.

PBX2 leverages several modern GPU features and techniques to achieve high performance:
- Instanced rendering
- Indirect GPU-driven rendering
- Multi-draw
- Bindless rendering
- Clustered forward rendering
- Depth pyramid culling

All these rendering techniques accelerate modern visuals:
- PBR rendering (with IBL)
- Moment shadow mapping
- Ground-truth AO
- Tonemapped HDR output
